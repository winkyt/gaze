# Stand with #Standing Rock

The Dakota Access Pipeline Protest (#NoDAPL) began in early 2016 in reaction to the approved construction of Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.

Local native American and environmentalists were gathered at both Standing Rock and #Standing Rock on Facebook to express their deep concerns.

Due to the fierce local conflict triggered by the proposed pipeline, environmental protestors were forced to leave their camping area at the Standing Rock. Today, it has become nearly impssible for people to access the former camping area. Even though, an increasing number of social media users still stand with #StandingRock via spoofing their check-ins on Facebook.

**Project Summary**
 
## 1. Introduction: 
Following months of conflict, triggered by a proposed pipeline, in January 2017, environmental protestors were forced to leave their camping area at Standing Rock. Today, it has become nearly impossible for people to access the former camping area. Even though protestors no longer stay there, a growing number of social media users still stand with #StandingRock by spoofing their check-ins on Facebook. With storymap techniques, this dynamic map geo-narrates the whole story of the environmental protest at Standing Rock and #standing rock.

## 2. Background:
 
Dakota Access Pipeline(DAPL) is an underground pipeline project, crossing states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois. It is designed to transport as many as 570,000 barrels of crude oil daily. The purpose of this project is relevant to the issue of energy security in the United States. The pipeline passes through the Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. 
 
Members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and some environmental supporters protested the project daily around the construction site. Even though the pipeline's developers claim that the pipeline is safe for the environment, the opposers say the environmental risks, especially water issue, are too great for it to move forward. They also compare the DAPL with the scrapped Keystone XL pipeline. Meanwhile, opposers concern that the pipeline will disturb historical and religious sites. 
 
Tensions between the pipeline developers and opponents developed since April 2016. Standing Rock Sioux elder LaDonna Brave Bull Allard established Sacred Stone camp as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the pipeline. Over the summer the camp grew to thousands of people. Later, two more camps were established in the area. People gathered at the camps to show their support.  
 
Early on October 31, 2016, a Facebook post said that the Morton County sheriff's department was using Facebook check-ins to target people at the protest camps. People outside of the protests camp checked-in to Facebook to ‘overwhelm and confuse' law enforcement officials, although police denied tracking activists on social media. The Check-in feature allows users to add their current or nearby location to posts on Facebook. However, people can falsify their location check-ins, which is known as location spoofing. Later, more and more people checked-in to the Facebook to keep an eye on the event. 
 
The purpose of this dynamic story map project is to show spoofing check-ins on Facebook related to the Dakota Access Pipeline Protest(#NoDAPL)  in Standing Rock recreation area, and how people use social media to speak up for themselves or show their supports. 
 
## 3. Methodology:
This dynamic story map project includes multiple maps, graphics, photos, video, and text information. After gathering all data, the process of data is broken down into the following steps 1). (Facebook data)2). use QGIS to process the geospatial data, 3).design and program files of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
 
1.
 
2.QGIS
Most data are in national scale. To reduce the size file, we use the clip tool to select aquifer, river, and reservation area. Also, we will QGIS to transfer all shapefile data into a geojson file so that the data can be inserted into the web page.

## 4. Tutorial:
1.This is a navigation bar. It includes all subjects of this web map. The check-in bottom contains three sub-subjects. You can click on the subject, and jump to a specific page. 
2.These four icons connect to about page and three external links. The first one from the left is the about page button. The second one (with Facebook symbol) and the third one(with Twitter symbol) allow you to share this website on your face, and the last one is a button to direct you Github page, where you can find the code and data of this page. 
3.A drop down arrow to help you go to the next page
4.A process bar to help you know where you are 
5.It is a click-on feature. Move the mouse to the picture; it will show you a larger size on the left panel. 
6."next page" button go to the left corner but still serves the same function as step 3
7.Check what people said about the standing rock event, move the mouse to the icon "F" at the page of check-in. 
 



 
## 5. Result:
The usage of geolocation based social media is not only concentrate on personal interests. Through the case studying of standing rock, it shows that people could use this function to show their supports on a specific events. From the Facebook Check-in page, 337,589 people check in to the topic of standing rock. According to Google Trends, the search volume of term “ standing rock” peaked at the end of 2016.
